    "Maria Mustermann\n",
    "Musterallee 1\n",
    "54321 Musterdorf\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extract only the Customer Name: `Maria Mustermann`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Invoice ID Example:**\n",
    "  - Valid formats:\n",
    "    - Rechnungsnummer: 1234567890\n",
    "    - Rechnungs-ID: ABCD123456\n",
    "    - Rechnung-Nr.: INV2024XY\n",
    "  - Invoice IDs typically appear near the top of the document and close to the customer name or billing address.\n",
    "  - Always look for these **German keywords** before extracting:\n",
    "    - \"Rechnungsnummer\"\n",
    "    - \"Rechnungs-ID\"\n",
    "    - \"Rechnung-Nr.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do NOT extract codes that:\n",
    "  - Appear in tabular sections, such as those under \"Referenz\", \"ISIN\", or \"Depot/Konto-Nummer\"\n",
    "  - Are short reference IDs like \"K23000076\" or ISINs\n",
    "  - Appear near securities or fund transaction details\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also ignore anything resembling a date or range:\n",
    "  - 01.01.2020\n",
    "  - 2020-12-31\n",
    "  - 01.01.2020 - 31.12.2020\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only extract the **actual invoice number** from the area where the **customer billing address appears** or where it's clearly labeled with the German keywords above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Vendor Name Example:**\n",
    " Deka\n",
    "Investments\n",
    "\n",
    "Vendor Name: Deka Investments\n",
    "- It usually appears at the top of the page, often styled as a logo or header.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The output should be in the following format:\n",
    "Vendor Name: <vendor_name>\n",
    "Invoice ID: <invoice_id>\n",
    "Customer Name: <customer_name>\n",

    "If customer name is not found, then do not print even the key \"Customer Name\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Be accurate, consistent, and minimal.\n",
    "\n",
